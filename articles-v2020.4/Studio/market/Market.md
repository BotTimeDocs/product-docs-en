# ENCOO Market

ENCOO Market includes:

- **Activity Market**. It offers a wide range of automation activities and artificial intelligence activities developed by ENCOO TECH and its partners. When flow designers cannot find the right activity that suits their business needs in the basic activities, they can try to search it in the activity market and download it to the project for use without the need to develop it by themselves.
- **Code market**. It offers a large number of NuGet code packages. You can embrace the active NuGet ecosystem through the code market and get access to a large number of NuGet applications to enhance flow editing efficiency.
- **Flow market**. It offers flows and flow templates that have been designed for a specific scenario and are ready for download and use. You can also take existing flows as a reference and modify the design to make it a custom flow that suits your business needs so as to greatly improve your flow editing.

In addition, ENCOO also supports enterprise users in deploying private markets. Please [contact us](https://www.encoo.com/apply) for details and we will be happy to assist you.
