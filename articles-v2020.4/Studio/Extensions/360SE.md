1. Manually open 360SE and type in the address bar <se://plugin-manager/>
2. Find **ENCOO Recorder** extension, and click **Enable**.

## Adjust Settings

Since the initial setup of 360SE is complicated and there are too many pop-up ads and prompt windows, which may affect the function of web automation, you need to check and adjust the relevant configuration after installing 360SE. Please refer to the following steps.

1. Click the Open Menu button in the upper right corner, and then click the Settings button. Then you will enter the settings screen of 360SE.
