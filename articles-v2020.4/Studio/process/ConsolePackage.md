3. In the resource group drop-down list, you can select the resource group you want to view. When the selection is complete, all the flows under that resource group will be loaded.

4. In the flow list, select the flow you want to view and click on it. Then you can view all versions of the flow in the version list.

5. In the version list, select a version you want to open and click on it. Then the flow will be automatically downloaded and opened.
   
   > **Note:**
   > 
   > If the current flow is a downloaded flow, when you re-open it, the prompt "The flow has been downloaded. Do you want to download it again" shall appear. If you choose Yes, it will overwrite the downloaded flow.

## Edit \& Publish Flow

2. Once the editing is complete, you can publish the flow to the console again.![Publish Flow](https://docimages.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/images/Studio/workingProcess/publishconsole20201112.png)
