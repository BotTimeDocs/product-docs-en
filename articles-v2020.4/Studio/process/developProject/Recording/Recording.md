# Smart Recording

**Smart recording** is an important part of the ENCOO RPA studio, that can help you save a lot of time when automating your business flows. This feature enables you to easily capture a userâ€™s actions on the screen and translates them into sequences.

Using the recording feature, after recording the automation flow projects, you can modify these projects and adjust the corresponding parameters so that you can easily recall them in other flows.

## Recording Description

When a yellow rectangular box appears in the interface, it means recording has started. At this point, you can click on the target element, as the rectangle represents the identified element. It also means you can click on it to get data or otherwise interact with it. As shown in the image below, in this way, you can be sure the correct buttons, texts, or menus are selected.

Keyboard shortcuts that you can use while recording:
