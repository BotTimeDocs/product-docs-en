When you export a flow through Studio, a flow package name will be defined. This name will be considered as the unique identifier for the flow package and is used to determine the latest version number available for this flow under the current resource group.

You can modify the version number and comments of the uploaded flow, click "OK" after confirming that there are no errors. The flow will be uploaded to the specified resource group of the console.
