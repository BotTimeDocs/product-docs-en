## Application Version

To avoid the management problems associated with application updates. The system will manage the version of the published applications. If an application is repeatedly published under the same department, the application package is considered as an iterative version of the previous application package and is distinguished by its version number.

Once the application version is uploaded, it cannot be modified or overwritten. Users can get all versions of the application in the Application.

Each time the application is enabled, users need to specify the version of the application that is enabled.
