# About License

This page is used to display the licensing period of the console license and the type and number of associated products and their usage. On this page, you can see the number of the robots and studios that are available to you.

Whenever a robot is added or a studio is logged in, you will consume the licensing number of a robot or studio. See: [Consume License](useLicense.md?_v=v2020.4)

## Community Edition License

When users sign up for a Community Edition account, they will get the license for a Community Edition console, a Community Edition studio, and a Community Edition robot.

The Community Edition license will not expire. If you have not logged into the console for more than one year, your account may be withdrawn. We will not specifically inform you.

Once you have purchased an Enterprise Edition console, you will see here the licensing period of the console you purchased, the type and number of associated products.

## Apply for Enterprise Edition License

You can apply for the Enterprise Edition console, studio and robot by clicking "Apply for Enterprise Edition" in the Community Edition console.

The Enterprise Edition console will contain all features that are marked with "Enterprise Edition only" in the documentation.
