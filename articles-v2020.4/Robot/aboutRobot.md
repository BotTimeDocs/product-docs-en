# About ENCOO RPA Robot

**ENCOO RPA Robot** is available in two editions: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

Each Community Edition console can activate one Community Edition robot, and the number of robots that can be activated for the Enterprise Edition is determined by the quantity purchased by the company.

After a robot is installed, you need to get the activation before you can use it, see [Activate Robot](license.md) for details.

You can create a local flow library in the robot or upload the flows to the console and get them through the online flow library. You can manually direct the robot to run these flows, or you can direct the robot to execute the flows through the console. See: [Flow Library](localworkflow.md).
