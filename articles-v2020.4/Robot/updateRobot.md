# Update Robot

When a new version of the robot is available, the system will automatically check and pop up an update window to prompt for updating.

If you select "**Accept and Continue**", the system will download the latest version of the robot and you can update the robot to the latest version by following the steps. ![robot](https://docimages.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/images/Robot/updaterobot.png)

If you do not want to update your robot at the moment, you can also select "**Do not update**" to close the dialog box.
